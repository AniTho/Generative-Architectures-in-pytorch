# Generative Architectures in pytorch
This repo consists of all the projects concerning generative models, done by me (in pytorch). Logs and results can be accessed via wandb (https://wandb.ai/aniketthomas/GAN%20Projects)

## Progress Chart:

1. Implemented Autoencoders (Reference paper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1127647). Also studied mathematical aspect of VAE and derived KL divergence for two normal distribution.
2. Implemented VAE (Reference paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)
3. Studied DCGAN paper and implemented it (Reference paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf)
